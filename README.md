# Enumeration-Project-Cybersecurity-Bootcamp
Capstone Project Enumeration and Boilerplation Completed by Danush Sridhar, David Leonard, Ty Blocker, and Jensen Servoss.
         For our final project we chose Enumeration Boilerplatation. To complete this assignment we wrote a python algorithm that runs on our VM Kali Linux Reconnaissance Lab. This program should be useful for both blue team and red team activities. Essentially it will enumerate the /20 subnet of a user determined IP address. The code is menu driven with three options that will allow for; a ping scan of the subnet, a port scan of the IPs obtained during the first scan, and a software version scan of those same IPs. First, we started with finding IP addresses on our network using a ping scan. This helps us identify active devices on our network. The script will prompt you to enter IP addresses. Itâ€™s important to enter them in the correct format. An IP address consists of four numbers separated by dots, where each number is between 0 and 255. For example, 192.168.1.1 is a valid IP address. If the format is correct, it will perform a ping scan. Otherwise, it will ask you to re-enter the address. Let's break down the validation process. The script splits the IP address into four parts and checks that each part is a number between 0 and 255. This ensures that the IP address is in the correct format before attempting a ping scan. After validating the IP address, the script uses NMAP to perform a ping scan. The command used is nmap -sn [IP]/20. The -sn option tells NMAP to perform a ping scan, which simply checks if the host is up without scanning ports. The ping scan will send ICMP echo requests to the IP address and wait for a response. If the host responds, it means the device is active and reachable on the network. The results will show whether the IP address is up and active. If the device responds to the ping, it will be listed as an active host. This information is essential for network administrators to identify which devices are currently connected to the network. You can add multiple IP addresses to the scan. The script will prompt you to enter another IP address after each scan, allowing you to build a list of active devices. After entering all the IP addresses, the script will display the scan results for each address. This comprehensive list of active devices will be used in the next steps for further analysis. At the end of the IP scan, you'll have a list of active devices on your network. This is the foundation for the subsequent port and version scans, as it tells you which devices to target for deeper analysis. Then perform a port scan on the identified IP addresses. This helps us understand which ports are open and listening on the devices. Open ports can indicate services running on the devices, which can be entry points for potential security threats. You'll be asked to enter a range of ports to scan. Ensure the starting port is lower than the ending port. For example, if you want to scan the commonly used ports, you might choose a range from 1 to 1024, which includes ports for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Once the range is set, the script will run the port scan on each IP address. This is how it looks in action. execute port scan: The NMAP command being executed here is nmap -p[start port]-[end port] [IP]/20. This command tells NMAP to scan the specified range of ports on the given IP address. The script executes the scan and provides a list of open ports for each device. For each open port, NMAP attempts to identify the service running on it. This information is crucial for network administrators to understand what services are accessible from the network. For example, port 80 typically indicates a web server running HTTP, while port 443 indicates HTTPS. Similarly, ports like 21 and 22 might indicate FTP and SSH services, respectively. Identifying these services helps in managing and securing the network. Using these results, network administrators can take actions such as closing unnecessary ports, securing services, and monitoring traffic to prevent unauthorized access. Port scanning is a fundamental step in network security assessments and helps in proactively managing potential threats. With a detailed list of open ports, you can now move on to further analysis, like running a version scan to get more details about the services.Finally, we perform a version scan using NMAP. This scan identifies the version of services running on the open ports. The script will run the version scan on the identified IP addresses. This gives us detailed information about the software versions, which is useful for vulnerability assessment. The NMAP command used here is nmap -sV. The -sV option tells NMAP to determine the version of the services running on open ports. This scan provides comprehensive details about each service, including its name, version number, and other relevant information. The version_scan function iterates through the list of IP addresses using a for loop. For each IP address, it clears the screen, runs the version scan, and displays the results. The version scan results provide detailed information about the running services and their versions, helping in identifying potential vulnerabilities. This process can take a bit of time, but it's worth it for the comprehensive insights it provides. The scan can reveal the specific version of a web server, database, or other services running on the device, for example, on IP address 172.31.10.153 as a result of the version scan we can see that port 22 is open and running on OpenSSH 8.7p1 Debian 4 (protocol 2.0). With this knowledge from a red team perspective we can search for known vulnerabilities for the version installed and exploit them. From a Blue team perspective we can take action in updating any outdated versions that patch vulnerabilities in the current version installed ensuring an increase in security. This data is essential for ensuring that all services are up to date and secure against known vulnerabilities. By comparing the scanned versions against known vulnerability databases, you can proactively address any security issues. This proactive approach helps in maintaining a secure network environment.
